     "Like This" by Rumi 

       If anyone asks you how the perfect satisfaction of all our sexual wanting will look, lift your face and say, Like this. 

       When someone mentions the gracefulness of the night sky, climb up on the roof and dance and say, Like this.

       If anyone wants to know what "spirit" is, or what "God's fragrance" means, lean your head toward him or her. 
       
       Keep your face there close, Like this. 

       When someone quotes the old poetic image about clouds gradually uncovering the moon, 
       
       slowly loosen knot by knot the strings of your robe, Like this.

       If anyone wonders how Jesus raised the dead, don't try to explain the miracle. Kiss me on the lips, Like this. Like this. 

       When someone asks what it means to "die for love," point here. 

       If someone asks how tall I am, frown and measure with your fingers the space between the creases on your forehead. This tall. 

       The soul sometimes leaves the body, then returns. when someone doesn't believe that, walk back into my house. Like this. 

       I am a sky where spirits live. Stare into this deepening blue, While the breeze says a secret. Like this. 

       When someone asks what there is to do, light the candle in his hand. Like this. 

       How did Joseph's scent come to Jacob? Huuuuu How did Jacob's sight return? Huuuu A little wind cleans the eyes. Like this. 

       When Shams comes back from Tabriz, he'll put just his head around the edge of the door to surprise us. Like this. 

   
    《就这样》 ---鲁米 

      如果有人问你 我们所有的性欲 都被完全满足 那会怎样？ 你就抬起你的脸 然后说 就这样 

      当有人谈论夜空的美妙 你就爬上屋顶舞蹈 然后说 就这样

      如果有人想要知道什么是“灵魂” 或者“神的芬芳”有何含义 将你的头靠近他或她 让你的脸贴得很近 就这样 

      当有人引用古诗的意境： 浮云渐渐遮住月亮 你就一节一节缓缓解开 你的长袍 就这样 

      如果有人怀疑耶稣如何让死人复活 ——不要尝试解释神迹 你就亲吻我的双唇 就这样，就这样 

      如果有人问 “为爱而死”是什么意思 你就指指这里 

      如果有人问我有多高 你要皱起眉头 用你的手指丈量 你额头皱纹的间距 这么高 

      灵魂有时离开身体 然后返回 如果有人不信 你就回到我的房间 就这样 

      我是灵魂居住的天空 凝视这越来越深的湛蓝 这时，微风在述说一个秘密 就这样 

      当有人问有什么事要做 你就点亮他手中的蜡烛 就这样 

      约瑟的香味如何被雅各闻到？ 呼—— 雅各如何复明？ 呼—— 一阵风儿扫净眼睛 就这样 

      当沙姆士从大不里士回来 他就会把头靠在门边 把我们吓一跳 就这样
